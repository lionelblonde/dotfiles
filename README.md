# Dotfiles and macOS system setup scripts

## System Preferences
+ Go to _Accessibility -> Pointer Control -> Mouse & Trackpad -> Trackpad Options..._ and select _Enable dragging_ with
  the _without drag lock_ option.
+ Go to _General-> Prefer tabs_ and select _never_.
+ Go to _Keyboard ->  Touch Bar shows_ and select _Expanded Control Strip_.

## More hidden settings
+ Install __TinkerTool__ by following the instructions at [this link](https://www.bresink.com/osx/TinkerTool.html).
+ The following setting are redundant if we are already using TinkerTool; here for legacy purposes
    + Enable key repeat: `defaults write -g ApplePressAndHoldEnabled -bool false`
    + Change the time it takes for the Dock to reappear fully; this time is in seconds
        1. `defaults write com.apple.dock autohide-time-modifier -float 0.15` to make the change
        2. `killall Dock` for this change to properly take effect
        0. To restore the Dock's appearance to its original setting, use the following command
            + `defaults delete com.apple.dock autohide-time-modifier;killall Dock`
+ Unlock the Karabiner apps, which are protected from deletion by default (a lock indicator is shown on the app icons)
    + N.B.: this only makes sense (and not even remotely necessary even then) if one wants to replace the app icons
    + _Why are these files [apps] protected?_ The Karabiner system of apps is a system-wide software, and files are
      installed at appropriate locations besides the Application folder. If you just put the application icon in Trash
      like a normal app uninstall, some files will be left behind. The file protection forces to use the built-in 
      uninstaller, which removes the installed files tied to the Karabiner system properly when one uninstalls.
    + This file locking is achieved with `schg` and `uchg` flags.
    + One can unlock the locked application files with the following commands:
        + `sudo chflags nouchg,noschg /Applications/Karabiner-Elements.app`
        + `sudo chflags nouchg,noschg /Applications/Karabiner-EventViewer.app`
    + Enter the administrator password upon executing these commands in a terminal; the apps should now be unlocked
    + N.B.: __remember to use the built-in uninstaller when one wishes to remove the apps__
+ Install __SCR Thumbnail Provider__ from [this link](https://smartcomicreader.com/thumbnailprovider/).
    + _What_ it does and _why_ it is a great little utility are both questions answered at the above link.

5. Verify that the completion package(s) specified in the `.vimrc` configuration is (are) installed; otherwise, do it

   the above command to benefit from automatic update support.
