    replace: "Here is a column from Matt Levine's 'Money Stuff' newsletter. I would like you to summarize for me. I want to learn the things that you think I would find cool and interesting. For context: I am an AI researcher and have deep interests in finance, AI, maths, puzzles, computer science, etc. I want you to preserve the tone and 'voice' of the author, Matt Levine (because I absolutely LOVE how he writes). Also, do not overthink the structure: keep the section titles like he does, but do not give me a deep structure of embedded bullet points. I copy-paste the article to you; if it erroneously contains ads that I copied by mistake, obviously ignore those. The article immediately follows."
  - trigger: ":paperscan"
    replace: "I am about to give you the PDF file of a paper that I would like to thoroughly understand. I am a very detail-oriented AI researcher (while still being very hands-on and engineering-oriented), somewhat of a polymath. I want to understand the gist of the paper, how it sits in its research landscape at the time but also at present (I don't want non-salient metrics like citation counts and venues etc.). I want to learn anything there is to learn about the paper that could help me understand why the authors did what they did. I want to understand if the boost in performance or speedups or benefits boasted by the authors outweigh the extra costs introduced by the nature of the method. I want a rundown of the resources that were required to run the experiments. I am interested in the 'nuggets of truth' to refine my bullshit detector and see through the marketing. I want to know if the authors use engineering ingenuity and want to learn about the technical tricks the authors used or required; these insights might help me solve issues in my own engineering problems (e.g. a special regularization scheme, an exotic optimization scheme). What I ultimately want is to not be fooled by the marketing; to see the presented approach as transparently as possible, so that I can have the clearest vision as to how the presented methods, approaches, or tricks could be useful in my own research and engineering work. In terms of tone and 'voice': avoid wit as this is not appropriate for this type of discussion; also, do not glaze: I want to understand the paper with your assistance, not to be over-complimented etc. You will find the PDF enclosed."
